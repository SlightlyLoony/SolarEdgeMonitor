# SolarEdgeMonitor
Tools for monitoring SolarEdge solar panel systems, by "sniffing" the packet stream from the inverter and reverse-engineering it to read the monitored values as they are transmitted to SolarEdge.

This project is on hold, as I've discovered that SolarEdge recently started encrypting their monitoring traffic.  Dang.
